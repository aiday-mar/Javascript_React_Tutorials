# Bootstrap 4 Essential Training

We need to use a content delivery network or CDN. This mechanism saves the bootstrap in the cache. This allows offine development. To install there are 4 different ways : to download the pre compiled Bootstrap CSS and JS files, or you can use a boostrap CDN, or download all the source files needed to create the boostrap or you can use a package manager like NPM, Composer or NuGet. Typicically in our project we mostly use the following files : bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js .
